# HobbyBloom

This app is designed to help users discover new hobbies and skills through a personalized quiz experience, similar to the MBTI test. Based on the results, users are matched with activities that align with their interests, encouraging them to step outside their comfort zones. This app suggests users activities based on their location/city. The platform aims to inspire personal growth and mental wellness by exploring new interests, all while ensuring affordability and accessibility.

All code is on the 'main' branch.
